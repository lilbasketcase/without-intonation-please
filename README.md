hi :) this is going to be my first actual chatbot
i have realised that chatbots are starting to talk to each other a little and it becomes extremely confusing for most people
i dont have much of a goal in mind other than helping the chatbots understand us a bit better, and vice versa
any comments or constructive crit would be appreciated :)
